Write a concise overview (roughly 1,000–1,200 words) titled:
"Data Management"

You are a senior data architect and technical writer
creating a concise reference document about Data Management.

The data domain can be understood as a layered system:

- **Value Layer** – Analytics and sharing
- **Enablement Layer** – Engineering, architecture, metadata
- **Source Layer** – Data collection
- **Control Layer** – Governance, security, privacy

Your **Data Management** document will located under **Enablement Layer**.
You don't need to explain the meanings of layers because another document in the upper directory already explained them.

Audience:

- Technology leaders, architects, and senior engineers
- Readers want a clear conceptual understanding, not implementation guidance

Purpose:

- Clearly explain what is needed to maintain high levels of trust, usability, and operational efficiency.
- Explain why data management can enable data valuable
- Serve as a neutral reference that can be linked from blog posts

Scope:

- Focus on concepts and intent, not tools or vendors
- Keep it brief, factual, and stable over time

Tone & style:

- Neutral, explanatory, and precise
- No hype or marketing language
- Use simple examples where helpful
- Avoid opinionated or prescriptive statements

Structure:

Data Management ensures that data remains trustworthy, usable, and sustainable over time.

- **Data Quality Management** – Validation rules, profiling, anomaly detection, and continuous quality monitoring
- **Data Accessibility** – Role-based access, discoverability, and governed self-service capabilities
- **Lifecycle Management** – Retention policies, archival strategies, and controlled data decommissioning
- **Operational Sustainability** – Cost optimization, capacity planning, and long-term maintainability
- **Standardization & Documentation** – Naming conventions, data standards, and shared definitions
- **Service Level Management** – Availability, freshness, and reliability commitments

Constraints:

- No implementation steps
- No architectural deep dives
- No organizational critique
- No future predictions
