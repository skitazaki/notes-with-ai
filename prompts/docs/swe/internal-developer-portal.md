- Keep it brief, factual, and stable over time

Tone & style:

- Neutral, explanatory, and precise
- No hype or marketing language
- Use simple examples where helpful
- Avoid opinionated or prescriptive statements

Structure:

1. Definition: What is an Internal Developer Portal?
2. The problems IDPs were created to solve
3. Key capabilities commonly found in IDPs
4. How IDPs fit into modern software organizations
5. What IDPs are _not_ (common misconceptions)
6. A short historical note on how and why they emerged

Constraints:

- No implementation steps
- No architectural deep dives
- No organizational critique
