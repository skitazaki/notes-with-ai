# Notes with AI

_My Personal Notes on Software Engineering, Data, and AI, Enhanced by Artificial Intelligence_

**Notes with AI** is a collection of personal notes focused on **software engineering**, **data**, and **artificial
intelligence**, co-created with the help of artificial intelligence. Each note is a collaboration between human
curiosity and AI's capacity to organize, extend, and refine learnings, explorations, and experiments. This repository
serves as an open, evolving notebook — a space for reflection, sharing, and continuous learning.

## Purpose of Notes with AI

- To organize and share knowledge in software engineering, data, and AI.
- To document personal growth and exploration in these fields.
- To create a living resource which evolves over time.

## Topics Covered

- Software Architecture, Development Practices, Engineering Principles, and System Design
- Data Engineering, Analytics, Data Systems, and best practices for managing and leveraging data
- Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Generative AI, and applications of AI techniques

## How to Read These Notes

They are not final answers, but starting points — prompts for further thinking, discussion, and creation. Each note is a
window into a moment of curiosity, made richer by technology but rooted in human perspective. Notes are collaboratively
created between human-driven exploration and AI assistance.

**"Documentation"** is structured by technical topics while **"Blog"** is a collection of random thoughts and technical
snapshots.
