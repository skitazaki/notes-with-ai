Hi, I'm Shigeru Kitazaki, who is a software engineer specialized in data engineering. This site is a collection of
personal notes focused on **software engineering**, **data**, and **artificial intelligence**, co-created with the help
of artificial intelligence. Each note is a collaboration between human curiosity and AI's capacity to organize, extend,
and refine learnings, explorations, and experiments. This repository serves as an open, evolving notebook â€” a space for
reflection, sharing, and continuous learning.
