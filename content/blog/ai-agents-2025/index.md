AI Agents have evolved from academic concepts to **production-ready building blocks** across cloud platforms, SaaS
startups, and enterprise systems.

This article explores the **tools, frameworks, protocols, and professional services** shaping AI agent adoption in 2025
for developers and tech leaders who want a crisp, practical view of where agentic AI is today‚Äîwhat to deploy, how to
wire it, and which standards matter.

## AI Agents overview

An **AI agent** perceives state (memory + tools + external data), decides, and **acts** via tools/APIs‚Äîoften over
multiple steps with plans, retries, and guardrails. This isn‚Äôt just chat; it‚Äôs orchestration with decisions and
side-effects. Good vendor intros capture this shift from ‚Äúchatbot‚Äù to **actionable automations**.
([What are AI agents? How they work and how to use them - Zapier][26])

**A Reference Architecture You Can Start From**

```mermaid

```

**Why this shape?**

- The **orchestrator** is a graph/state machine (e.g., LangGraph, Semantic Kernel, AutoGen) that coordinates tools &
  sub-agents reliably. ([LangChain][13], [Microsoft Learn][15], [Microsoft GitHub][14])
- **Policy & guardrails** sit in the runtime (provider services increasingly bundle this). ([Microsoft Learn][3])
- **Tools** integrate via protocols & connectors (MCP, Logic Apps, Bedrock action groups, Vertex tools).
  ([Anthropic][5], [Microsoft Azure][4], [AWS][1], [Google Cloud][2])

### 2x2 Matrix of AI Agents

Categorizing AI agents by **two axes** ‚Äî

- **Interactive vs. Non-interactive** (i.e., conversational/real-time vs. backend/automation)
- **Customer-facing vs. Corporate team‚Äìfacing** (external vs. internal)

gives a **2√ó2 framework** that‚Äôs easy for engineers and decision-makers to understand.

     ([Adept][56], [Leadership change][57])
   - **Notion AI Agent** ‚Äî Beyond summaries, it now orchestrates content creation and database actions across
     workspaces.
   - üëâ Agents here act as **knowledge assistants**, blending memory + automation.

2. **Enterprise Productivity Suites**

   - **Microsoft Copilot (Office 365)** ‚Äî Embedded agents in Word, Excel, Teams; not just assistants, but **workflow
     agents** across the suite.
   - **Google Duet AI (Workspace)** ‚Äî Document drafting, meeting summaries, and Gmail actions.
   - **Salesforce Einstein Copilot** ‚Äî CRM-specific agent that updates records, generates forecasts, and drafts customer
     interactions.
   - üëâ These agents are **domain specialists**, leveraging enterprise data.

3. **Developer Productivity Agents**

   - **GitHub Copilot** ‚Äî now beyond autocomplete to a **developer companion agent**: generating functions, writing
     tests, and suggesting fixes, and even orchestrating workflows across repos and services.
   - **Cursor** ‚Äî An IDE with a built-in agent that can refactor, explain, and run code iteratively. ([Cursor][45])
   - **Devin** ‚Äî Autonomous coding agent which acts as a software engineer capable of planning, writing, testing, and
     deploying code‚Äîlargely with minimal human guidance. ([Devin][54])
   - üëâ These tools embed agents _where developers work_, creating tight feedback loops.

4. **Communication & Scheduling Agents**

   - **Clara / Motion** ‚Äî Calendar & scheduling agents that negotiate meetings automatically via email/Slack.
     ([Clara][58], [Motion][59])
   - **Superhuman** ‚Äî An AI-driven email assistant that drafts, summarizes, and follows up automatically.
     ([Superhuman][65])
   - üëâ These succeed when they blend **autonomy** (do it for you) with **transparency** (you stay in the loop).

5. **Consumer Lifestyle Agents**

   - **Rabbit R1** ‚Äî A pocket-sized device with a **Large Action Model (LAM)** agent that executes tasks across apps via
     natural language. ([Rabbit][66], [Wikipedia][67])
   - **Humane AI Pin** (Discontinued) ‚Äî A wearable agent projecting voice/visual interaction, designed for **ambient AI
     assistance**. ([Wikipedia][68])
   - **HeyPi by Inflection AI** ‚Äî A **personal conversation agent**, oriented around empathy and coaching. ([HeyPi][69],
     [Inflection AI][70])
   - **Character.AI** ‚Äî Multi-character conversational agents for entertainment, roleplay, and companionship.
     ([Character.AI][71])
   - üëâ These are pushing agents **into devices and everyday interactions**.

6. **Specialized Domain Agents**

   - **Legal / Compliance Agents** (Harvey, EvenUp) ‚Äî Draft contracts, briefs, and filings with law-specific knowledge.
     ([Harvey][72], [EvenUp][73])
   - **Healthcare Agents** (Glass Health, Hippocratic AI) ‚Äî Provide diagnostic reasoning, triage, or patient
     communication support. ([Glass Health][74], [Hippocratic AI][75])
   - **Finance Agents** (Kasisto) ‚Äî Autonomous assistants in banking, budgeting, and financial Q\&A. ([Kasisto][76])
   - **Customer Service** (unitQ) ‚Äî Analyzes product feedback across channels in real time to help companies improve
     product quality and customer experience. ([unitQ][77])
   - üëâ These thrive in **verticals** with strong domain expertise + regulatory guardrails.

**Why This Matters**

End-users increasingly expect agents inside their tools: whether that‚Äôs IDEs, email, or calendars. For developers and
enterprises:

- **Protocols like MCP and A2A** ensure these user agents can safely interact with enterprise data & APIs.
- **Frameworks like OpenAI Agents SDK** are the rails under the hood powering many of these.

So the frontier is:

- **Enterprise copilots** ‚Üí connecting with enterprise systems via MCP/A2A.
- **Personal/lifestyle agents** ‚Üí building trust, transparency, and multimodality (voice, wearable, ambient).

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-start -->
{{< callout icon="sparkles" >}}
 End-user agents are a great starting point to understand **interaction design**
 and how **protocols like MCP** may one day unify agents across tools.

### Case Study - Devin

**Devin** ([devin.ai][54]) is an advanced **autonomous coding agent** developed by Cognition AI (formerly Cognition
Labs), which acts as a software engineer capable of planning, writing, testing, and deploying code‚Äîlargely with minimal
human guidance. It supports a wide range of engineering tasks from refactoring and bug fixes to building full
applications.

**Key Features:**

- **End-to-end autonomy**: Devin can generate a project plan, code it, test it, and deploy it, handling thousands of
  decisions over time. ([Cognition AI][51], [Wikipedia][53])
- **Built-in developer tools**: Devin operates with a shell, code editor, and browser, all within a sandboxed
  environment for safe execution.
- **Collaborative workflow**: Devin reports its progress in real time, accepts feedback, and adjusts designs
  interactively.
- **High performance on benchmarks**: Devin resolved 13.86% of SWE-bench issues end-to-end‚Äîsignificantly higher than
  previous bests of \~2% unassisted.
- **Multi-agent capabilities**: Later versions support dispatching sub-tasks to other agents and use self-assessed
  confidence to ask for human guidance when unsure.

**Developer Use Cases:**

- Code migrations and refactoring (e.g., language upgrades, version changes)
- Data engineering and ETL workflows
- Bug fixes, CI/CD tasks, and backlog cleanup
- Feature development, testing, documentation, and onboarding

**Company and Growth:**

- Cognition AI was founded in late 2023 by IOI gold medalists and is backed by Founders Fund and others, rapidly scaling
  from a \$350M to a multi-billion-dollar valuation. ([Wikipedia][55])
- In mid-2025, Cognition acquired **Windsurf**, an agentic developer IDE, expanding its tooling ecosystem.

## The Protocol Layer: MCP and A2A

Two emerging protocols are shaping the way agents **interact with tools and with each other**.

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
  - Defines a structured way for LLMs to access external tools, databases, and APIs.
  - Used by Anthropic and OSS community for tool-augmented reasoning.

- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**
  - Defines messaging and collaboration between agents.
  - Key for **multi-agent systems** where specialized agents collaborate on tasks.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Agent1 as Agent A (Planner)
    participant Agent2 as Agent B (Executor)
    participant API as External API

    User->>Agent1: Request (e.g. "Generate report")
    Agent1->>Agent2: Delegation via A2A
    Agent2->>API: MCP call to fetch data
    API-->>Agent2: Data response
    Agent2-->>Agent1: Processed result
    Agent1-->>User: Final answer
```

### MCP ‚Äî Model Context Protocol

- **What it is:** An **open protocol** (origin: Anthropic) that standardizes how assistants connect to **tools, data
  sources, and dev environments**‚Äîthink ‚ÄúUSB-C for AI tools.‚Äù Implementations and docs are public and rapidly evolving.
  ([Model Context Protocol][6], [Introduction by Anthropic][5], [Wikipedia][9])
- **Why it matters:** Avoid N√óM bespoke adapters; agents can discover tool schemas & call them safely. Growing industry
  interest. ([The Verge][8])

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Agent
  participant MCPClient as MCP Client
  participant MCPServer as MCP Tool Server
  participant API as External API

  Agent->>MCPClient: request(tool="payments.create_link", args)
  MCPClient->>MCPServer: JSON-RPC (capabilities, schema)
  MCPServer->>API: REST/GraphQL call with auth
  API-->>MCPServer: result
  MCPServer-->>MCPClient: normalized result
  MCPClient-->>Agent: structured output + tool logs
```

The **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Registry** is the official community-driven directory of MCP servers, clients, and
tools. It lists implementations, libraries, and integrations that enable AI agents and applications to communicate via
the Model Context Protocol, helping developers discover reusable components and ensure interoperability across the
ecosystem. ([MCP Registry][94], [GitHub][95], [InfoQ][93])

### A2A ‚Äî Agent-to-Agent Protocol

- **What it is:** An **interoperability spec** so agents on different platforms can **discover each other, exchange
  capabilities, and coordinate** with auth & sandboxing. Google has described A2A on its developer blog.
  ([A2A Protocol][11], [GitHub][12], [Google Developers Blog][10])
- **Why it matters:** Multi-agent, cross-vendor workflows (e.g., your CRM agent talks to a procurement agent without
  brittle webhooks).

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant AgentA
  participant Directory as A2A Directory/Registry
  participant AgentB

  AgentA->>Directory: discover("procurement.approve")
  Directory-->>AgentA: endpoint + capabilities + policy
  AgentA->>AgentB: propose(task, schema, scopes)
  AgentB-->>AgentA: accept + contract
  AgentA->>AgentB: messages + tool results
  AgentB-->>AgentA: status + artifacts + audit trail
```

> **Related:** The **AG-UI** (Agent User Interaction Protocol) spec focuses on **frontend‚Üîagent** streaming & tool UX;
> it‚Äôs gaining traction via Pydantic AI integration. ([AG-UI][7], [Pydantic AI][27])

### AgentGateway

**AgentGateway** is an open-source platform designed to standardize and simplify how AI agents interact with external
systems through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. It provides a registry of MCP servers and tools, enabling
developers to discover, connect, and compose AI agents across multiple providers and ecosystems.
([agentgateway.dev][91], [GitHub][92], [Linux Foundation][96])

By supporting both **MCP** and **Agent-to-Agent (A2A)** communication, AgentGateway helps unify fragmented agent
architectures, allowing enterprises to build multi-agent workflows that are interoperable, secure, and scalable.

- It acts as a **‚Äúhub‚Äù for AI agents**, similar to an API gateway, but tailored for MCP-compliant ecosystems.
- The platform supports governance, observability, and integration with enterprise systems.
- Consulting firms and enterprises can leverage AgentGateway to accelerate **proof-of-concepts (PoCs)** for multi-cloud,
  multi-agent AI systems.

## Architecture Patterns

1. **Tool-First Agents with MCP**

   - Use MCP servers for internal systems (payments, CRM, inventory) so agents can **discover** and **call** tools
     consistently.
   - Layer approval policies + logging at the MCP boundary.

2. **Graph Orchestration for Reliability**

   - Represent the agent as a **graph** with explicit states (plan, act, reflect, finish) and backoffs/retries.
   - LangGraph and Semantic Kernel both push this **deterministic** shape.

3. **Human-in-the-Loop Checkpoints**

   - Approval nodes for risky actions (purchases, deletions). Cloud runtimes help enforce content safety + identity.

4. **Multi-Agent via A2A**

   - Use A2A to **discover** domain agents (e.g., Finance/Procurement) and contract scopes/SLAs, rather than ad-hoc
     webhooks.

**Example**: _Minimal Production Topology_

```mermaid
flowchart TB

    Gateway["API Gateway / Auth"]
    AgentSvc["Managed Agent Service<br>(Bedrock Agents / Azure Agent Service / Vertex AI)"]
    Tracing[Tracing & Eval]
  end

  end

  Gateway --> AgentSvc --> MainAgent
  MainAgent --> SubAgents
  MainAgent --> MCP
  SubAgents --> A2A
  MCP --> Apps
  MainAgent --> Tracing
  MainAgent -. optional .-> SaaS
```

**Security & Governance Checklist**

- **Identity & scopes** at the tool boundary (per-tool OAuth/keys, short-lived tokens).
- **Data guards** (masking, content filtering, tenant separation) in the agent runtime. Cloud agent services provide
  first-class controls. ([Microsoft Learn][3])
- **Approval workflows** for high-impact actions (purchase, write, delete).
- **Auditability** (trace tool calls, inputs/outputs, cost).
- **Sandboxing** for code execution tools (Vertex built-ins, containerized sandboxes). ([Google Cloud][2])

**Evaluating Agents (beyond demos)**

- **Task success rate** (end-to-end, not just answer quality)
- **Tool correctness & schema fidelity** (Pydantic AI is strong here)
- **Latency budget** (plan/act loops + tool RTTs)
- **Operator workload** (how often humans must approve/fix)
- **Stability under change** (tool versioning, schema drift‚ÄîMCP helps)

**Build vs. Buy**

- **Start with Cloud + SaaS** when you need compliance/identity, many connectors, and fast ROI (e.g., Zapier Agents +
  Bedrock/Vertex/Azure runtime). ([Zapier][24], [Amazon Web Services, Inc.][1], [Google Cloud][2], [Microsoft Learn][3])
- **Go OSS** when you need deep control flows, experimental features, or custom workflows (LangGraph/SK/AutoGen +
  MCP/A2A). ([LangChain][13], [Microsoft Learn][15], [Microsoft GitHub][14], [Anthropic][5])
- **Adopt user-facing tools** like Copilot or Manus for immediate productivity boosts, while building your own backend
  orchestration.

## Enterprise Adoption

When adopting AI agents in production, organizations often rely not only on open-source frameworks or cloud services,
but also on **consulting firms** and **system integrators (SIers)** that provide expertise in architecture, governance,
and integration. For engineers, these services offer practical insights into how OSS, cloud platforms, and emerging
protocols (like MCP and A2A) can be combined effectively.

<!-- deno-fmt-ignore-start -->
{{< callout type="info" >}}
Consulting firms are not just for strategy ‚Äî they publish reference architectures and SDK blueprints
that engineers can reuse in internal agent projects.
{{< /callout >}}

production-ready stacks.

## Developer Starting Points

Agentic systems are solidifying around **three pillars**: a **orchestration layers**, **standardized tool access
(MCP)**, and **inter-agent interoperability (A2A)**. Pick a cloud or OSS orchestrator you can live with, standardize
tool access early, and measure actual **task completion** with guardrails‚Äî_not_ just chat quality.

Here is a short list of developer frameworks and libraries which you should be familiar with.

- **User-facing tools**: Devin (developer productivity) and Manus (workflow automation) bring agents directly to end
  users.
- **Cloud providers** now ship first-class agent runtimes: **Amazon Bedrock Agents/AgentCore**, **Azure AI Foundry Agent
  Service**, and **Google Vertex AI Agent Builder**. These give you hosting, tool safety, identity, observability, and
  connectors out of the box.
- **OSS & developer frameworks** have matured: **LangGraph**, **AutoGen**, **Semantic Kernel** (Agent Framework),
  **CrewAI**, **Haystack**, **LlamaIndex** (Workflows/agent framework), and **PydanticAI** (type-safe agents), plus new
  entrants **Genkit (Google)**, **OpenAI Agents SDK**, **Strands Agents (AWS)**.
- **SaaS platforms** (e.g., **Dust**, **Zapier Agents**, **Fixie**) productize agent operations, connectors, and
  human-in-the-loop UX. Recent funding and releases show momentum.
- **Open protocols**‚Äînotably **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** and **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**‚Äîaim to make agents
  interoperable across tools and vendors. MCP standardizes how models access tools/data; A2A standardizes agent-to-agent
  messaging and capabilities exchange.

## Closing Thoughts

AI agents are moving quickly from tools to ecosystems. In 2025, engineers will need to master:

- **Cloud & Frameworks** (LangGraph, Genkit, AWS/OpenAI SDKs)
- **Protocols** (MCP for tool use, A2A for agent collaboration)
- **Enterprise adoption models** (Consulting firms, SIers, governance layers)

Meanwhile, user-oriented tools (Copilot, Manus) are making agents feel real to end-users. On the developer side, OpenAI
Agents SDK, Genkit, and Strands Agents are making it easier than ever to build robust, production-ready agents.

The future of AI agents is not just about better LLMs.
It‚Äôs about standardized protocols, orchestration frameworks, and integration into enterprise systems.
This is where engineers can lead.
