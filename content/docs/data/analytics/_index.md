Data analytics is a series of activities that involve recognizing patterns in data, uncovering insights from the past to
the future, and connecting them to actions using quantitative outcomes.
It encompasses everything from collecting, organizing, and storing data to analyzing it, publishing the results, and applying them.

Data analytics converts structured and unstructured data into actionable intelligence.
