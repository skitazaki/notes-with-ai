# Notes with AI

My personal notes with AI contents generation.

## Developer Guides

Run `hugo` development server on a local machine.

```bash
hugo server --minify
```

Go to `http://localhost:1313/notes-with-ai/` with your web browser.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

See the official document [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/host-and-deploy/host-on-github-pages/).
`.github/workflows/hugo.yaml` has configurations of build and deployment jobs.
